# Dysnomia
A Discord bot using [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js).

Join our [official Discord server](https://discord.gg/0elfiqPj377LHmek) for questions and feedback!

Note: This is experimental. This is in-development. This probably won't work. This probably will confuse you.

### Setup

1. Get Node v4 or above
  * Windows: Get the right MSI (32 or 64 bit depending on your system) from [the official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  * Mac:
    * Easy: The [official .pkg installer](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) is easy to install
    * Recommended (but harder): [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) allows for easy switching/upgrading of node versions
  * Linux:
    * The Node.JS versions in the default repositories are probably outdated. Use either [NodeSource's binaries](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
2. Download the bot
  * If you don't have Git on your computer (or don't know what Git is), [download a ZIP of the repository](https://github.com/abalabahaha/Dysnomia/archive/master.zip) and unzip it.
  * If you have git, open a terminal window and type `git clone https://github.com/abalabahaha/Dysnomia.git`
3. If you haven't already, open a terminal window and navigate into the Dysnomia directory
4. Do `npm install`
5. Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` and edit the values as appropriate

After setup, you can run the bot using `node dysnomia.js`.
